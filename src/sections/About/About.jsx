      I've always had a deep interest in technology, ever since I was a youngster. At seven, I began helping my uncle in his LAN gaming center, setting up computers and working on networks. By the age of fifteen, I snagged my first IT job as a basic computer technician. I was really passionate about the field, so I took a bunch of courses to sharpen my skills, from getting to grips with office software to learning about computer repair. Then, at 24, I made my way back into the IT scene in Florida, focusing on fixing laptops. It was around this time that I discovered coding. It seemed pretty challenging at first, but I was determined, and eventually, I grew to love it. One thing I can promise is that I give my absolute best in every project I tackle.
